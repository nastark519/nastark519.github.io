### Deploying in the cloud.

+ So starting out I went on to the Microsoft Azure site and tried to register an account. After waiting for 4 hours for the card verification to load and it not finnishing I thought I would try to us the Microsoft Imagine and that took 5 min. to do.

+ I then went to the portal page of Azure and loged in.

+ Then clicked on "SQL Databases" from ther I clicked on the "+ Add" at the top of the inner split screen.

    + Since I can only have one Free database as per the Microsoft Imagine insted of the pay as you go Microsoft Azure.
    
    + I have deployed on the cloud for this home work thought I had to take this site down in order to deploy for the final and was told that I need to keep the final deployed to through friday, 12/08/2017, thus I will redeploy on the fallowing Saturday, 12/09/2017. Also the following screen shots will show deployment.
    
    + I the created a server. At this point it is importand to use a admin name and password that you will need to remember.

+ Then I went back to the Visual Studio project to connect and run the sql up file to setup and seed the database on Azure.

    + For this the admin name and password were needed. Aswell as the Database name that we set up in Azure.
