 1. Learning Git and its commands.
    + I already had the git bash downloaded onto my lab top and I have used it to make a README file for a "hello world" repository, but I had not really gotten into any of the power of git. I learned several commands such as:

        ```shell
        git init
        ```
        + which I would use once I had made a folder for my a repository and then I would start coding and making changes to my files in my folder.
        ```shell
        git add .
        ```
        + was used to add all my changes to all of my files in the folder of my repository.
        ```shell
        git commit -m "Some comment to know what changes I have been working on, and why."
        ```
        + If I was happy with my changes I would make them permanent with committing to it.
        ```shell
        git config --global user.name "MyName"
        git config --global user.email "MySchoolEmail.@afjfja.edu"
        ```
        + I reset my user name and email to be more coherent.
        ```shell
        git status
        ```
        + To check everything was working how I wanted i.e. my `add`s and `commit`s were working as I thought the were.
        ```shell
        git log
        ```
        + To look through and check my `commit`s and see if I needed to go back to any. I maybe used it three time not to needed for HW1.
        ```shell
        git remote
        git remote add nickNameForURL (theExactURL)
        ```
        + I used the `remote` command to one make a remote to `push` my repo. to and also to check the spelling of the nick name I chose for it.
       + `git fetch` I haven't actaully used this command. Its one I'll have to look up.
       ```shell
       git pull
       ```
       + I used when I was having trouble `push`ing my repo to github because there was a file added to the repo that I was aimed at, so I pulled that file into the repo I had locally and then I was able to procced without further troubles.
       ```shell
       git push remoteName branchName
       ```
       + I would use this to push the changes that I had made on my local repo to my repo on github.
