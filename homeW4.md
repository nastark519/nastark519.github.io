# Home Work Four
 
### Objectives 1 and 2.
+ 1 and 2 are mashed together as I learned ASP.NET MVC 5 by building this web app.

	+ I started with making folders Home and Shared in Views
	+ Then I made a HomeController and initialized an index page for my home landing.
	```C#
	// GET: Home
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
	```
